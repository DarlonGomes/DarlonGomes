## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 My name is Darlon and I love to build stuff.



ðŸ’»  I'm currently a Fullstack Web Dev student at Driven Education.

  - I've been working with React and Javascript in the last projects;
  - The project planning process is where I have the most fun.
  

ðŸ§° I'm a Jack-of-all-trades.

- I worked as a full-time furnite maker for seven years;
- In the last two years, I taught how to make furniture with raw wood;
- I took some courses in welding, pottery , masonry and cooking.
